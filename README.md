# Software Design Review & Refactoring Assignment

## Objective
Review and refactor the provided code by applying sound **software design principles**.

## Instructions
- Choose **one programming language** in this repository.
- Review the existing code in that language.
- Refactor and optimize the code using principles such as:
  - Single Responsibility
  - Open/Closed
  - Interface Segregation
  - Dependency Inversion
  - High cohesion, low coupling
- Preserve the original functionality unless clearly justified.

## Git Workflow
- Create and work on **your own branch**.
- Commit all changes only to your branch.
- Do **not** push directly to the main branch.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Quality of applied design principles
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Clean structure and meaningful abstractions
- Proper use of Git branching

## Notes
- Multiple solutions are acceptable.
